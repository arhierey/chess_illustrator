The London System is an excellent opening for White because of its versatility. White can play the London against many different defenses from Black. This also makes it easier and faster to practice because you can play it more often.

The London has gained a reputation for being too boring and dull since the main line and attacking strategy is for the most part, the exact same every single time you play it. However, this doesn’t have to be the case, there are ways of putting pressure on your opponent earlier than usual in the game. The main line for White is 1. d4 2. Bf4 3. Nf3 4. e3. Depending on what Black plays, the sequence of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th moves may be different, but those moves will be made.

The London is one of the best openings for beginners with the White pieces because of its ease of learning and the fact that it’s a system. Meaning it can be played against nearly anything Black plays. For more information, see the step-by-step tutorial on how to play the London System opening.

Danish Gambit Main Line
Danish Gambit Main Line
Many players will tell you that playing tricks and gambits in the opening isn’t the “right” way to learn Chess because you’re not learning the opening principles because you’re hoping your opponent will fall for some trick. However, this isn’t always the case. The Danish Gambit, as well as a few other select gambits are sound openings regardless of whether or not your opponent accepts the gambit. And besides, Chess also has to be fun, and the Danish loads of fun to play.

A common line in the Danish is 3…dxc3 and if you’re unfamiliar with the Danish, you may think well, you have to recapture the pawn now right? Actually you can sacrifice yet another pawn and just develop a piece, commonly 4. Bc4. And Black could take accept another gambit with 4…cxb2 and now White would recapture with 5. Bxb2.

Danish Gambit Rapid Development
Rapid Development For White at the Cost of Two Pawns
Now look at this position. White has a pawn in the center as well as a Bishop. And White’s other Bishop is out. Now look at Black. Cricket’s anyone? Black doesn’t have one piece developed.

White sacrificed three pawns in exchange for a massive lead in development. Was is worth it? Absolutely. It’s not uncommon for White to win in less than ten moves if Black accepts the Danish.

There are possible drawbacks to be aware of when playing this gambit. After the beginner level ratings, stronger intermediate players are going to know what to play against the Danish. For example, this is a common line that Black could respond with that leads to a disadvantage for White, even after accepting all three of the gambit pawns.

Why It’s One of The Best
White can gain a massive gain in development for the cost of just two or three pawns.
It’s fun to play which will help encourage you to keep learning, practicing, and improving.
